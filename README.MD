Project description : 
Customer Due Deligence /Enhance Due Deligence checks are currently manual, repetitive and costly to all financial companies.
To prevent Anti-Money laundering and other financial crimes, regulators are also getting more and more stingent on Know Your Customer checks for Due Deligence.
Further Customer also needs to submit similar identify and financial documents related to specific financial products everytime with each of the financial institutions and 
sometime even in multiple departments within same financial institutions which creates frustrating and negative experience to customer.
Additionally these deligence checks needs to be done not at the time of onboarding of customer but also on year on year basis to comply with AML regulations.
Currently there is no singe golden source of KYC data for the customers available to banks and reason why each financial institution has to perform due deligence saperately 
resulting huge cost to the institution. Also any fraudlent activity perfomed by a customer with one institution is very lately noticed by other financial institutions due to 
which these institutions runs in the risk of penalise heavily by regulation.

Blockchain based due deligence address above mentioned challenges while keeping self-sovereignty of the customer data in the control of the customer itself.
